# Data Import

## API Import

run `api.mjs`, and then compare files in `transformed/` to `data/` in root. Because there is no endpoint for effects some manual work needs to be done, but we can start with buffs supplied by the traits endpoint.

## Buff Types / Source

- Trait
- Boon
- Condition: default combatant is target instead of player
- Relic
- Common: superspeed, stealth, revealed
