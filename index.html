					ID number.

						<strong>Unpinned</strong> - these effects are placed in a dynamic

				<h3>Pack Options</h3>

					<li><strong>Pack Name</strong> - the name for your totem</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Layout Direction</strong> - this is the direction that your
						totem will extend as more effects are included

				<h3>Feedback</h3>
				<p>
					As there is no effect endpoint in the official GW2 API, I had to
					create my own list. If there are inconsistencies you can feel free to
					leave feedback or PRs in
					<a href="https://github.com/stormalize/totem-forge">GitHub</a>.
