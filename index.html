					Craft your own Reffect pack that allows you to reorder and "pin"
					important effects for your particular build.
				</p>
				<p>
					NOTE: packs created here rely on a set of custom images that are not
					included with the main pack file! Make sure you have downloaded and
					installed the main
					<a href="https://github.com/stormalize/totem">Totem ZIP file</a> which
					contains all the required images.

				<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<h3>Quick Start</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						If you have not done so previously, download and install the main
						<a href="https://github.com/stormalize/totem"
							>Totem pack ZIP file</a
						>
					</li>
					<li>
						Click on some items under Available Effects to include in your totem
					</li>
					<li>
						Reorder your included effects as needed, moving them above the "Pin"
						marker to dilineate between pinned and unpinned effects
					</li>
					<li>Copy the "Generated Pack" JSON text.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Available Effects</h3>
				<p>
					Click on an available effect to include it in your totem, click again
					to remove it. Effects may be filtered by category or searched by name.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some effects are represented by more than one ID in-game. For those
					effects, the full set of IDs can be seen by hovering over the "main"
					ID number.
				</p>
				<h3>Included Effects</h3>
				<p>Included effects are divided up into two presentations:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Pinned:</strong> these effects are permanently visible in a
						fixed location, and have a special graphic when maximum stacks are
						reached (for effects that stack in intensity)
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Unpinned:</strong> these effects are placed in a dynamic
						list and will only show up if the effect is present, while still
						preserving order
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					These two categories allow you to order effects by how important they
					are to you, as well as pin the most important for maximum readability.
				</p>
				<h3>Pack Options</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Pack Name:</strong> the name for your totem</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Layout Direction:</strong> this is the direction that your
						totem will extend as more effects are included
					</li>
				</ul>
